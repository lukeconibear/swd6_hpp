# Summary

In this workshop, we aimed to cover:

1. [x] Understand how to profile Python code and identify bottlenecks (with [timeit](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-timeit), [line_profiler](https://github.com/pyutils/line_profiler), and [SnakeViz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/))
2. [x] Understand how to choose the most appropriate data structure, algorithm, and libraries for a problem
3. [x] Improve the execution time of Python code using:  
    - [x] Vectorisation (with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/ufuncs.html))  
    - [x] Compilers (with [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/))  
    - [x] Parallelisation (with [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) and [Ray](https://www.ray.io/))  
    - [x] GPUs (with [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [CUDA/Numba](https://developer.nvidia.com/how-to-cuda-python), and [RAPIDS](https://developer.nvidia.com/rapids))  
4. [x] Understand when to use each technique
