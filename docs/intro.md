## Content
Over the past few years, Python and the wider Python ecosystem have become invaluable tools in scientific computing and data analytics. As Python is (for the most part) an interpreted language there are complaints that Python code can be quite slow to execute. In this hands-on workshop you will have the opportunity discover and use a set of tools and techniques that can be used to improve the execution speed of your Python code. The workshop will introduce a number of ways to both measure the efficiency of your code and improve itâ€™s speed of execution by introducing strategies for fast and scalable computation with Python.

This workshops tocuhes on:
- Optimisation
- Profiling
- Built-in functions
- Data structures and algorithms (caching, lazy loading)
- Vectorisation
- Compilers ([CPython](https://www.python.org/), [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/), [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), [Cython](https://cython.org/))
- Parallelisation ([Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/), [Ray](https://www.ray.io/))
- GPUs
